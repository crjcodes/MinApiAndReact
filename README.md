# Purpose

This project solution is a learning tool using .NET 7 to have a API and (eventually) a React UI talking to each other.

## Tech Used

- .NET 7
- OpenApi


# Status

Currently, a bare-bones skeleton for the eventual goal.  Runs in debug only for now, via the UI's launch settings environment variable for the API url.

# Details

## Data

The lab data is currently mocked up, coming in through json files loaded as part of the API's app configuration.
